              We are the first ever interstellar tour package providers. It was a dream for humanity and finally we were able to fulfill it. 
              Through asteroid mining, we were able to extract enough anti-matter which allowed us to travel at monumental speeds. 
              This efficient system broke the speed barriers and now we're able to travel to the planets surrounding different star systems. 
              We constantly strive to make your experience as amazing as possible. We are Celestia and join us on our voyage to the unexplored!!!
